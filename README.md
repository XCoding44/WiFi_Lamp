# WiFi_Lamp
WiFi Lamp with rgb leds and transparent crystal polystyrene

## The goal
This project is made to begin with the ESP-12E WiFi module : The LEDs placed under the polystyrene (on the slice) light the drawings and imperfections in the polystyrene... These LEDs can produce all colors with only one line of data (only one cable to transmit the informations to the LEDs) and each LED can be selected.

## The code
I will put a description of the code in the future so that everyone can understand what it does and can adapt it to what he really wants.
For this project, the control of the LEDs is made by a web "page" (really simple but clear one) : so you can control this lamp from every device that support a web browser. The control of the LEDs is made by the ESP-12E himself.

## Few instructions
I coded with Arduino IDE and to upload the sketch on the ESP, I used the package of boards for all the ESPs :
http://arduino.esp8266.com/versions/2.3.0/package_esp8266com_index.json (if you don't know how to use it, go to the Wiki of this project and search for "Additional Boards")
